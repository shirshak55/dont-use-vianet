# Vianet Nepal is shitty ISP


If you are going to purchase new subscription then please make sure its not vianet. I have subscribed vianet for 1 year. And today I got FUP message. FUP stands for fair use policy. Except vianet policy is not fair I would say this is shittest thing I have ever read.


According to their FUP if we download 500gb in a month our internet would slow down by 8mbps and after +100gb (total 600gb) it internet speed will reduce by 4mbps. 


Why 500 GB is very less?
- If you watch 4k video like 5 hour for a day then you will reach 500GB easily.
- I am developer and when I download chrome from source it easily takes like 30-40GB. So for learning and check code if i download edge browser, brave browser I can spend 100gb easily. 
- Games like Dota is around 20GB. 

So you can reach 500GB easily and you will get slapped with their FUP Policy.

Vianet thinks their subscriber use only facebook and youtube . (In this case I reached FUP due to watching youtube alone). 

They say their internet plan is unlimited. Yes I know we have limited resource so there is no such thing called unlimited. But here they have rate limit like 20 MBPS so they must give 20MBPS internet at any cost. They advertise in facebook like as if their service is best, unlimited and many thing bla bla bla. I call this bullshit and cheap marketing.


And regarding the speed they don't even give 20mbps. If we complain we are getting slow speed what their support do is download file from local cache (youtube, centos cached in Nepal/ India) and download using multiple connection. And if you try to measure internet speed from US server then you will realize the truth they have been cheating us.



I have used wordlink in past, classictech etc. But wanted to try vianet and now would recommend nobody to use vianet.
